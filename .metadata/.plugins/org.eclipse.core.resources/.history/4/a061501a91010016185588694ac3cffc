Delta Hanto TODO::
Due Date: 4/18/16 @ 11:59 PM

Implementations: 
 - Surrender : Player has the right to surrender at any time
 	:: pass all null to make move to surrender
 	:: returns other player wins to do that
 	
 - Piece Restrictions
 	:: 1 Butterfly		<Walk 1 hex>
 	:: 4 Sparrows 		<Fly >
 	:: 4 Crabs    		<Walk up to 3 hexes>  
 
 
 
BugFix's:
 - Run Pollice's tests and find errors
 	:: Cannot move a sparrow if there is no butterfly 				(x1)
 	:: Cannot move a sparrow to an occupied hex 					(x1)
 	:: Butterfly must be placed by the 4th move. for both players 	(x2)
 	:: Try to move a piece that the color didn't have				(x1)
 
 
Order of Op:
 - Fix Bugs
 - Implement surrender
 - Implement crabs allowed
 - Implement crabs walking 3 hexes
 - Refactor validator's
 	:: Group similar functions into one class that runs checks
 - Implement Sparrows allowed
 - Implement sparrow flight
 	:: Will need refactoring of validators.
 - Continue with refactoring... 

Refactor Needs:
 - Do commonality and Variablility analysis 
 	:: Need to find what's common amongst all hanto games
 	:: encapsulate those commonalities into a base class so that 
 	:: :: your data is better distributed -- Start working towards a template pattern
 - Group validators/checkers such that classes are not built 
 	:: around 13 lines of code.
